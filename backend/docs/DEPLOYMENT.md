# Deployment Guide

## Overview

This guide covers the deployment options and best practices for the BouvetRadar Backend application. The application is designed to run in various environments, from local development to cloud production deployments.

---

## Deployment Options

### Local Development

The simplest deployment option for development and testing purposes. The application runs directly on your local machine using the built-in Flask development server.

**Requirements:**
- Python 3.13+
- Doffin API key in environment variables

**Access:** `http://localhost:8080`

### Production with Gunicorn

For production deployments, Gunicorn (Green Unicorn) is the recommended WSGI HTTP server. It provides better performance, stability, and concurrency handling compared to Flask's development server.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple worker processes for handling concurrent requests
- Configurable timeout and binding options
- Request logging capabilities
- Process management

**Worker Configuration:** Typically 2-4 workers per CPU core for optimal performance.

### Container Deployment (Docker)

Containerization provides consistency across different environments and simplifies deployment. Docker packages the application with all its dependencies into a portable container.

**Benefits:**
- Consistent environment across development and production
- Easy scaling and orchestration
- Simplified dependency management
- Isolation from host system

**Docker Compose** enables multi-container setups and is useful for local development or small production environments.

### Cloud Platforms

The application can be deployed to major cloud providers, each offering different features and benefits:

#### Azure App Service
Microsoft's platform-as-a-service (PaaS) offering with built-in scaling, monitoring, and easy integration with other Azure services.

#### AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Amazon's PaaS that automatically handles deployment, capacity provisioning, load balancing, and auto-scaling.

#### Google Cloud Run
Serverless container platform that automatically scales based on traffic and charges only for actual usage.

#### Heroku
Platform-as-a-service known for simplicity and ease of deployment, ideal for quick prototypes and small applications.

## Configuration Management

### Environment Variables

The application requires configuration through environment variables, primarily for sensitive information like API keys. For local development, these are stored in a `.env` file that should never be committed to version control.

**Required Variables:**
- `DOFFIN_API_KEY` - API key for accessing Doffin procurement data

**Optional Variables:**
- `FLASK_ENV` - Environment mode (development/production)
- `LOG_LEVEL` - Logging verbosity (INFO, DEBUG, WARNING, ERROR)

### Production Configuration

Production deployments require specific considerations:

**Debug Mode:** Should always be disabled in production to prevent security vulnerabilities and improve performance.

**CORS Configuration:** Cross-Origin Resource Sharing should be configured to allow only trusted frontend domains rather than all origins.

**Security Headers:** HTTP security headers should be enabled to protect against common web vulnerabilities.

---

## Monitoring and Observability

### Health Checks

The application provides a health check endpoint at `/api/health` that returns the application's status and version. This endpoint is essential for:
- Load balancer health checks
- Container orchestration readiness probes
- Monitoring system status checks
- Automated deployment verification

### Application Logging

Production deployments should implement structured logging with:
- Rotating log files to prevent disk space issues
- Appropriate log levels for different environments
- Timestamp and context information for debugging
- Integration with centralized logging systems

### Monitoring Solutions

Various monitoring tools can be integrated:

**Prometheus:** Metrics collection and alerting for performance monitoring
**Application Insights (Azure):** Microsoft's application performance management service
**CloudWatch (AWS):** AWS native monitoring and logging
**Stackdriver (Google Cloud):** Google's operations suite for monitoring

---

## Performance Optimization

### Worker Configuration

Gunicorn worker processes handle concurrent requests. The optimal number depends on:
- Available CPU cores (formula: 2-4 workers per core)
- Expected request patterns
- Memory constraints
- Application workload characteristics

### Caching Strategy

Performance can be significantly improved through caching:
- **Static Data:** CPV codes can be cached indefinitely
- **API Responses:** Doffin search results can be cached briefly
- **SSB Data:** Classification data can be cached with moderate TTL
- **HTTP Caching:** Browser and CDN caching for static responses

### Database Considerations

When a database is added in future versions:
- Connection pooling for efficient database connections
- Query optimization and indexing
- Read replicas for scaling read operations
- Caching layers (Redis/Memcached) for frequent queries

## Security Best Practices

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

**Application Security:**
- Disable debug mode and verbose error messages
- Configure CORS for specific trusted origins
- Store sensitive data in environment variables or secrets management
- Enable HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Keep dependencies updated with security patches

**Infrastructure Security:**
- Use secrets management services (Azure Key Vault, AWS Secrets Manager)
- Implement network security groups or firewalls
- Enable audit logging for security events
- Use private networks for backend services
- Implement authentication and authorization
- Regular security scanning and vulnerability assessments

### HTTP Security Headers

Production deployments should set standard security headers:
- **X-Content-Type-Options:** Prevents MIME-type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options:** Protects against clickjacking
- **X-XSS-Protection:** Enables browser XSS protection
- **Strict-Transport-Security:** Enforces HTTPS connections
- **Content-Security-Policy:** Prevents XSS and injection attacks

---

## Backup and Recovery

### Configuration Backup

Environment configuration and deployment settings should be documented and backed up. An `.env.example` file should be maintained in version control to document required variables without exposing sensitive values.

### Future Database Backups

When a database is implemented:
- Automated daily backups with retention policies
- Point-in-time recovery capabilities
- Backup testing and restoration procedures
- Off-site backup storage for disaster recovery

### Version Control and Rollback

Maintain version tags and release history:
- Tag releases in version control
- Document changes in changelogs
- Keep previous versions available for rollback
- Test rollback procedures regularly

---

## Continuous Integration and Deployment

### CI/CD Pipeline Benefits

Automated deployment pipelines provide:
- Consistent deployment procedures
- Automated testing before deployment
- Reduced human error
- Faster deployment cycles
- Automatic rollback on failures

### Pipeline Stages

A typical CI/CD pipeline includes:

1. **Testing:** Run automated tests on code changes
2. **Building:** Create container images or deployment packages
3. **Staging:** Deploy to staging environment for validation
4. **Production:** Deploy to production after approval
5. **Verification:** Run smoke tests post-deployment

### Popular CI/CD Tools

## Troubleshooting

### Common Deployment Issues

**Port Conflicts:** Port 8080 may already be in use by another application. Identify and stop conflicting processes or use a different port.

**Permission Issues:** Ports below 1024 require elevated privileges. Use port forwarding or configure the system to allow non-privileged port binding.

**Application Crashes:** Check application logs for error messages. Common causes include missing environment variables, dependency issues, or configuration errors.

**Memory Issues:** Insufficient memory can cause worker crashes. Monitor memory usage and adjust worker count or increase available memory.

**API Connection Failures:** Verify API keys, network connectivity, and external service status. Check firewall rules and DNS resolution.

### Diagnostic Tools

- Application logs for error messages and stack traces
- System logs for infrastructure issues
- Container logs for containerized deployments
- Cloud provider monitoring dashboards
- Network diagnostic tools (ping, curl, telnet)

## Scaling Strategies

### Horizontal Scaling

Adding more application instances to handle increased load:
- Deploy multiple instances behind a load balancer
- Use container orchestration (Kubernetes, Docker Swarm)
- Implement stateless application design
- Use shared session storage (Redis) if needed
- Distribute across availability zones for reliability

### Vertical Scaling

Increasing resources for existing instances:
- Add more CPU cores for compute-intensive operations
- Increase RAM for data processing
- Upgrade network bandwidth for high-traffic applications
- Monitor resource usage to identify bottlenecks

### Load Balancing

Distributing traffic across multiple instances:
- **Round-robin:** Distributes requests evenly
- **Least connections:** Routes to least busy server
- **IP hash:** Maintains session affinity
- **Health checks:** Removes unhealthy instances

Load balancers can be implemented with:
- Cloud provider services (Azure Load Balancer, AWS ELB)
